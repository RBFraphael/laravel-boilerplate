### Additional components for Laravel

- This package adds a Repository class for Laravel, for you to implement Repository pattern.

- This package adds a WithUuid trait for using with models, that is supposed to have a "uuid" column alongside to traditional "id".

- This package adds a Enum class that should be extended to implement your own Enum with static values and a method to get label for each value.
